Hello World indeed. I turn 35 this month. I was told that this firmly puts me in the "Mid-thirties" demographic but definitely not in the "mid-life" bracket. The world sure has changed a lot since I last wrote a [blog post five years ago](https://theprodigalblog.blogspot.com/2015/09/a-lot-has-happened.html).

I'm not really sure what this blog will have to offer the world, but I will do my best to articulate my experience of culture and life at this time and my resolution in the face of it. "Culture war" is a phrase often used to describe the times we're in; the conflict between "liberals" and "conservatives", "pro-life" and "pro-choice", social justice and "responsibility", gun rights and gun safety. Increasingly I am more and more uneasy with the terms of engagement defined for living in and interacting with our society. I know I'm not the [only](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2019/may-web-only/elusive-presence-1-heart-of-evangelical-crisis.html) [one](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/opinion/sunday/christians-politics-belief.html).

A few years ago, my good friend Joel, shared a book with me: [Culture Care by Makoto Fujimura](https://amzn.to/2LRBH5U). It's a bit of an esoteric book -- but it had a through line of themes and ideas that resonated with me. A Christian call to empathy and generativity. The former, a willingness to skillfully and patiently listen, understand, and relate to others across typical social boundaries. The latter, a willingness to reconsider a life of consumption, and embrace the act of creating or doing something good to express beauty, truth, and love. The decision to wage **culture care** instead of _culture war_. I therefore do resolve to try and do what I can to take this tenuous moment of crisis and be a conduit through which people around me may experience peace, joy, love, beauty, and truth. Which brings me [here](https://www.jrhoun.com). And doing crazy things like this:

Will it last? Will these things make a difference? Honestly, I have no idea - but I know that I've been blessed to be a blessing and we all gotta start somewhere.

We had reservations to camp in Yosemite this past week. Obviously that didn't happen:

The lemonade still tasted good though.
