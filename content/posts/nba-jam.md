When I was in fourth grade, my grandmother signed me up for a church basketball league. I didn't know anyone or have any friends on the team, but for some reason that didn't deter me. Why? Because I *literally* thought I was the **best** basketball player. Let's run down the facts as they stood at the time:

* Experience playing organized team sports? **None**
* Played basketball on a regular basis? **Nope**
* Knew a lot about the sport from watching televised basketball? **Nah. I don't think I had ever watched a real basketball game before.**

So why did I think I was god's gift to this 4th grade basketball team?

I played a *ton* of [NBA Jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Jam) on Super Nintendo. I won 4th place in the local [Blockbuster Video Game Tournament](https://nintendowire.com/news/2015/07/07/the-history-of-nintendo-competitions-part-3/). I knew that if you pump faked a couple times, that you could increase your odds of making a shot. These virtual virtues would no doubt translate over to real basketball. How could they not?!

You are allowed to laugh. I certainly laugh, and cringe about it.

So, anyways, I thought I was the best basketball player because of my superior NBA Jam skillz -- that is until I showed up for our first practice. I remember the coach. I remember the other players on the team. And, I remember the moment we were told to do a lay-up drill. What's a lay up? How do I dribble? Where do I stand for a free throw? I did a few pump fakes during a scrimmage and but a shot up, but air balled?! People laughed at my airball. Oh. This. Is. Not. What. I. Thought. It. Would. Be. Like.

That practice was only a preview of the blow to crushing blow my outlandish 4th grade ego would take that season.

Later that season I remember one particular game where our team trailed another in the 4th quarter. Time was ticking down, the opposing team was in possession of the ball. Full court press time! I was guarding the player with the ball. Our coach shouted out to me,

> "Foul him! Foul him!"

"What?" I was bewildered. What does that mean? You want me to intentionally hurt him? I had literally no concept for what an intentional foul looked like. And so, I *slapped* (yes, slapped) at the player who was dribbling up the court. I don't know what he was thinking, nor do I know what the referee was thinking, but I think they were all *really* confused by my behavior. I'm pretty sure someone else came up later and fouled the player so we could stop the clock.

In retrospect, its amazing to me that I lasted as long playing basketball as I did -- up through freshman year of high school. It's also a revelation to me that people put up with me at all on that team - from my coaches to my teammates. I'm still very grateful for that time. Prior to playing on that team, I really had no pre-existing concept of what it meant to be on a team, to develop skills (practice) with intentionality and discipline, and how you *actually* play basketball.

Most importantly, years later those relationships would be used by God to put me in a position to hear and understand the Gospel for the first time. One of the friends I made on that team drove me to youth group almost every week. And youth group led to ultimately to me hearing the Gospel.

Thank God for NBA Jam.
